# RAIC-2016
Russian AI Cup 2016.
This contest will allow you to test your programming skills by creating an artificial intelligence (strategy) to control a wizard in a special game world. The contest rules are based on a popular computer game genre MOBA. In each game you will confront 5 strategies of other players. At the same time, you will have 4 allies. Each five strategies make a faction: Academy or Renegades. The main goal of the faction is to destroy an opponent faction base. The main personal goal of each wizard is to gain maximal possible amount of points. The winner of the game, as well as other places, is determined by the gained score. A player is given points when his wizard deals damage, destroys or is just hanging nearby during death of opposite faction’s unit, as well as for some other actions. Each player of a faction is given a significant amount of points in case of reaching the main faction goal.
Rules of the game almost entirely correspond to the classical canons of the genre. Faction bases are connected with three roads (top, middle and bottom ones), between which a forest is located. There are guardian towers on the roads: 2 per faction on each road. So, in the beginning of the game there are 14 buildings. Every now and then faction bases generate 3 equal minion squads: one for each road. The squads follow the roads to the opposite faction’s base, attacking any enemies on their way.
2 rounds and final took me 3 weeks and about 70 hours.
